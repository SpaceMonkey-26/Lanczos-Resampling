This MATLAB code resamples any grayscale (not RGB) image/stack to increase or decrease the number of pixels in the image(s). This does so by creating a Lanczos reconstruction kernel for each pixel, then multiplying each kernel by its own windowed/normalized weighted sinc(x) function, therefore interpolating the image(s). If the image is a stack, then each slice is handled independently.
